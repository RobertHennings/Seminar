DEEP Reinforcement (RL) is one of the most successful and recent techniques in
the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It has been successfully applied to
various fields, including robotics, gaming, and finance. In this paper, we
explore the application of Deep RL in the context of algorithmic trading in
the electricity market. We propose a novel approach that combines Deep RL
with advanced neural network architectures to optimize trading strategies.
Our method leverages historical market data and real-time information to make
informed trading decisions. We evaluate our approach using a comprehensive
dataset from the electricity market and compare it with traditional trading
strategies. The results demonstrate that our Deep RL-based method outperforms
conventional approaches, achieving higher returns and lower risk. This
research contributes to the growing body of literature on AI applications
in finance and provides valuable insights for practitioners in the energy
trading sector.
